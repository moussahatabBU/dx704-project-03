The algorithm I choose is the Thompson Sampling. I chose this algorithm as it yielded the best results out of the 3 algorithms I tried. 
Thompson Sampling resulted in the second highest average reward with second lowest variance, E-greedy resulted in the highest reward but with higher variance than Thompson Sampling
and the Upper Confidence approach resulted in the lowest average reward but also the lowest variance. While these results were all so similar, Thompson sampling had a great balance between exploration and exploitation.
